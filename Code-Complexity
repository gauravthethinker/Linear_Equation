The complexity of this program depends on the size of the input matrix A. 
Specifically, the time complexity of the singular value decomposition (SVD) operation, np.linalg.svd, is O(n^3), where n is the dimension of A.
The subsequent operations, such as creating the D matrix, calculating the pseudoinverse, and computing the least-squares solution, have lower time complexities and can be considered negligible compared to the SVD operation.

Overall time complexity of this program is O(n^3), where n is the dimension of A.
