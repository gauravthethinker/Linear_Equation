Some Advantage of this program is:
-----------------------------------

1.The program uses the SVD decomposition method, which is efficient for computing the least-squares solution of a system of linear equations.
I have done some analysis and it says that QR factorizatio is not most efficient method for solving very large or sparse linear systems.
That is the reason I have used SVD decompostion method

2.It is robust, the SVD decomposition is a robust method for solving linear systems, as it can handle cases where the system may be ill-conditioned or singular.

3.The program calculates the norm of the residual, which gives an indication of the accuracy of the computed solution.

4.This program is felxible , program can handle any matrix size, which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications.


Some of the disadvantage which this code is :
----------------------------------------------
1.linear_eqation_class class does not have any error handling or input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the input data is not in the expected format.

2. Currently the program does not provide any options for user interaction or input of custom data, which limits its usefulness and flexibility.
